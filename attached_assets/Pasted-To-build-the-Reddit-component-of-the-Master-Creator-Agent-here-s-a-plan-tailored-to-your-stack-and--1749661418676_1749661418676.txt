To build the Reddit component of the Master Creator Agent, here’s a plan tailored to your stack and goals:

---

### 🔧 Reddit Agent: Design Overview

#### **Objective**

Ingest top AI-related creators or contributors from Reddit—especially those consistently posting in subreddits like r/ArtificialInteligence, r/LLMs, r/ChatGPT, etc.—to identify high-signal users contributing to AI discourse, projects, or tools.

---

### 🧠 Core Features

#### 1. **Subreddit Crawler (Reddit Search API / PRAW)**

* Pull threads and comments from target subreddits.
* Prioritize posts with keywords like “project,” “repo,” “tutorial,” “dataset,” “prompt engineering,” “agentic,” “LLM,” “OpenAI,” “LangChain,” “AutoGPT.”

#### 2. **Creator Extraction**

* For each high-engagement post, extract the author.
* Cross-reference usernames across Reddit and other platforms (optional matching with Twitter/GitHub if they share links or same alias).

#### 3. **Engagement Scorer**

* Score based on:

  * Upvotes (avg & 30-day trend)
  * Comment karma
  * Submission frequency
  * Awards received
  * Top comment scores

#### 4. **Niche Tagger (LLM)**

* Summarize post/comment content.
* Classify user into tags like: “prompt engineer,” “AI tools builder,” “opinion leader,” “research explainer.”

#### 5. **Output Formatter**

* Add to Supabase/Postgres or export to Sheets:

```ts
{
  username: "LLM_DevGuy",
  platform: "Reddit",
  subreddit: "r/LocalLLMs",
  karma: 2843,
  engagement_score: 71,
  tags: ["LLM tools", "open source", "builder"],
  profile_link: "https://reddit.com/u/LLM_DevGuy"
}
```

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools

| Component       | Stack/Tool                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Reddit API      | PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) or Pushshift  |
| Ingestion Agent | Python + httpx + n8n trigger (daily or weekly) |
| Data Cleaning   | pandas + regex for summarizing + GPT tagging   |
| Classification  | Flowise/GPT-4                                  |
| Storage         | Supabase/PostgreSQL                            |
| Dashboard       | Next.js 15 + Tailwind + Shadcn                 |
| Auth            | Clerk.dev or Supabase                          |
| Export          | Airtable / Google Sheets                       |

### 🔄 Scheduling

* **Daily Crawler Job**: Pulls top 100 posts from 5–10 subreddits and filters top 10 creators.
* **Weekly Update**: Updates scores, tags, and adds new users.

---

### 🧪 Sample Subreddits

* r/MachineLearning
* r/ArtificialInteligence
* r/LocalLLMs
* r/PromptEngineering
* r/AutoGPT
* r/ChatGPT
* r/LLMOps

### 🚧 Tradeoffs / Notes

| Issue                                      | Solution                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pushshift API often rate-limited or down   | Backup with PRAW + `prawcore.exceptions` handler              |
| Username linkage across platforms is fuzzy | Only attempt when explicit links exist                        |
| Reddit profiles are semi-anonymous         | Still valuable for community insights or recurring commenters |

### ✅ Next Steps

1. Set up PRAW and test basic crawler.
2. Create scoring rubric (karma, post/comment ratio, etc.).
3. Define LLM prompts for niche classification.
4. Plug output into Supabase.
5. Build minimal frontend for internal review.

Want me to mock up the PRAW script or write the Flowise LLM tagger prompt next?
